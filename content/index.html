    <h3>What is this <span>&quot;Code Retreat&quot;?</span></h3>
    <p>A Code Retreat is a whole day long <strong>(9 hours!)</strong> exercise in Pair Programming and TDD. We start early - 8am, but rest assured that the experience is well worth getting up at the brink of dawn. After introductions, a cup of coffee, a bite to eat and an explanation of the problem we are going to solve. We will proceed with 3 programming sessions, each 45 minutes long and ending with a retrospective. Oh, and did we mention pair programming? You will be switching pairs after each session. Next we will have a nice, relaxing, catered lunch break <strong>(yay! free food!)</strong>, followed by 3 more sessions and a final retrospective. And as if it is not enough, there is going to be an after-party in the House of Beer with free... beer ;-) <strong>(yay! free beer!)</strong>.</p>

    <p>You will get all of this free stuff thanks to our awesome and generous sponsors: <a href="http://www.abb.pl/isdeliverycenter" class="txt1">ABB</a> and <a href="http://lumesse.com/" class="txt1">Lumesse</a>.</p>

    <h3>Game of Life? Not this time!</h3>

    <p>Usually, during Code Retreats, we solve Conway’s Game of Life. This time however, we will do something different.
      An aged legacy codebase awaits you! Like in real life, you will aproach it and experience a broad range of feelings.
      The ultimate goal is to practise in a low-stakes environment away from the code base that probably torments you at work.
    </p>

    <p>As usual, after each session all code will be deleted. This way, you are free to experiment with any techniques you find necessary</p>

    <p>You can also find a detailed description of this problem on <a href="http://whatis.legacycoderetreat.com/" class="txt1">this page</a>.</p>

    <h6>This all sounds nice and well, but I don’t feel like coming all the way to Kraków for just one day of fun...</h6>

    <p>One day of excitement is not enough for you? Kraków is a beautiful city, with tons of pubs, clubs, restaurants and historical monuments, and it is well connected with many European cities by cheap airlines. It’s really a perfect spot for a weekend trip.</p>

    <p>You might also be interested in <a href="http://foobarcamp.sckrk.com" class="txt1">FooBarCamp</a> - an unconference organized by SCKRK the day before, on Friday the 7th of December.</p>

    <h6>OK, I’m game, how do I sign up?</h6>

    <p>Code Retreat is free of charge, however the seating is limited, so <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sc-krk/events/90017372/" class="txt1">registration</a> is required.</p>
    <p>You are free to choose the programming language that you are going to use, just bring a laptop with a power adapter, your favorite programming environment set up and an open mind.</p>
