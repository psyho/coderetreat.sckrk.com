    <h3>What is this <span>&quot;Code Retreat&quot;?</span></h3>
    <p>A Code Retreat is a whole day long <strong>(9 hours!)</strong> exercise in Pair Programming and TDD. We start early - 8am, but rest assured that the experience is well worth getting up at the brink of dawn. After introductions, a cup of coffee, a bite to eat and an explanation of the problem we are going to solve <strong>(Game of Life)</strong>, we will proceed with 3 programming sessions, each 45 minutes long and ending with a retrospective. Oh, and did we mention pair programming? You will be switching pairs after each session. Next we will have a nice, relaxing, catered lunch break <strong>(yay! free food!)</strong>, followed by 3 more sessions and a final retrospective. And as if it is not enough, there is going to be an after-party with free beer <strong>(yay! free beer!)</strong>.</p>

    <p>You will get all of this free stuff thanks to our awesome and generous sponsors: <a href="http://www.abb.pl/isdeliverycenter" class="txt1">ABB</a> and <a href="http://lumesse.com/" class="txt1">Lumesse</a>.</p>

    <h3>Game of Life?</h3>

    <p>Conway’s Game of Life is the traditional problem solved during code retreats. It’s a 0-player game, meaning that after initially setting up the board, it evolves automatically requiring no user input. </p>
    <p>There are only a couple of rules governing the board evolution: </p>
    <ul class="list2">
      <li>The board is an infinite, two dimensional grid of square cells.</li>
      <li>Every cell has eight neighbors.</li>
      <li>At any given moment in time a cell may be in either of two states: dead or alive.</li>
      <li>The cells change state every turn and all at once.</li>
      <li>The next state of a cell is determined by the state of it’s neighbors:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="list7">
      <li>If a live cell has fewer than two live neighbors, it dies of underpopulation</li>
      <li>If a live cell has two or three live neighbors, it lives on to the next generation</li>
      <li>If a live cell has more than three live neighbors, it dies of overcrowding</li>
      <li>If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes a live cell</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also find a detailed description of this problem on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_game_of_life" class="txt1">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

    <h6>This all sounds nice and well, but I don’t feel like coming all the way to Kraków for just one day of fun...</h6>

    <p>One day of excitement is not enough for you? Kraków is a beautiful city, with tons of pubs, clubs, restaurants and historical monuments, and it is well connected with many European cities by cheap airlines. It’s really a perfect spot for a weekend trip.</p>

    <p>You might also be interested in <a href="http://foobarcamp.sckrk.com" class="txt1">FooBarCamp</a> - an unconference organized by SCKRK the day before, on Friday the 7th of December.</p>

    <h6>OK, I’m game, how do I sign up?</h6>

    <p>Code Retreat is free of charge, however the seating is limited, so <a href="http://coderetreatkrakow.eventbrite.com/" class="txt1">registration</a> is required.</p>
    <p>You are free to choose the programming language that you are going to use, just bring a laptop with a power adapter, your favorite programming environment set up and an open mind.</p>
